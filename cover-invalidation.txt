Improve TLB invalidation logic

Current code invalidates single page and entire range for the given
domain ID. IOMMU hardware supports multiple page invalidation.
This series adds support to invalidate range of pages.

Also consolidate various invalidation functions, remove unused functions,
re-arranges invalidation related functions.

Note that this series doesn't add support for PASID based invalidation (except
PASID 0 for v2 page table). We will include necessary changes in SVA series.

Testing:
  - This series is tested with v1 and v2 page table and it works fine.

This patch series is based on top of SVA Part 2 [1] which in turn based on
top of iommu/next branch (Commit 8e5ab3f54a10).
