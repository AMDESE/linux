iommu/amd: SVA Support (part 2) - deprecate iommu_v2 module

This is part 2 of the 4-part series to introduce Share Virtual Address
(SVA) support. This series removes iommu_v2 module support.

AMD GPU driver which was the only in-kernel user of iommu_v2 module is
removing dependency on iommu_v2 module [1].

[1] https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/122124/

Also subsequent series will add SVA spuport in AMD IOMMU driver. Device
drivers are expected to use common SVA framework to enable device
PASID/PRI features.

Hence this series removes iommu_v2 module and the functions used to support
iommu_v2 modue. Note that there are certain functions (ex: PPR interrupt
handling code) which will be used in subsequent series for SVA support.
Hence not removed those functions.

This patch series is based on top of SVA Part 1 [1] :
  <TODO: Update Part 1 link >

  Also to build kernel with this series either we need above AMD GPU
  related changes [1] -OR- compile with kernel config 'CONFIG_HSA_AMD=n'.

This is also available at github :
  <TODO: Updated latest branch name>
