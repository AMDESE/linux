iommu/amd: SVA Support (part 2) - refactor support for GCR3 table

This is part 2 of the 3-part series to introduce Share Virtual
Address (SVA) support, which focuses on refactoring GCR3 table.
This moves GCR3 related information from protection domain
structure to iommu_dev_data (per device) structure.

It contains the following enhancements:

* Patch 1:
  Rename helper function

* Patch 2 - 8:
  Introduce per device GCR3 table and code refactoring

* Patch 9 - 10:
  Add support for iommu_v2 module to adopt to new interfaces

* Patch 11:
  Remove unused variable from protection domain structure

This patch series is based on top of SVA Part 1 [1] :
