iommu/amd: SVA Support (part 2) - deprecate iommu_v2 module

This is part 2 of the 4-part series to introduce Share Virtual Address
(SVA) support. This series removes iommu_v2 module support.

AMD GPU driver which was the only in-kernel user of iommu_v2 module is
removed dependency on iommu_v2 module. These changes are already in
upstream (v6.6 merge window).

Also subsequent series will add SVA spuport in AMD IOMMU driver. Device
drivers are expected to use common SVA framework to enable device
PASID/PRI features.

Hence this series removes iommu_v2 module and the functions used to support
iommu_v2 module. Note that there are certain functions (ex: PPR interrupt
handling code) which will be used in subsequent series for SVA support.
Hence not removed those functions.

This patch series is based on top of iommu/next branch (Commit 8e5ab3f54a10).

Changes from v3 -> v4:
  - Rebased on top of iommu/next branch
  - Added 'Tested-by'
